1. SETUP Mode
	- Entered by resetting NUCLEO
	- GREEN LED is OFF
	- Pump Motor is off
	- Terminal Displays "SETUP MODE"
	- Get inputs for Inlet, Zones 1-3
		0 is manual, 1 is 60, 2 is 80, 3 is 99
		ONLY 1 ZONE/INLET CAN BE CONNECTED WITH MOTOR RUNNING EACH HOUR
	- Get inputs for current, inlet, zone 1-3 wall clock
		expressed in 24hr
		needs to be scaled down (2.4 minutes = 24hr, 0.1 min = 1hr); use MCU Timer to drive variables
		NO OVERLAP OF WALL CLOCK ENTRIES (EXCEPT FOR STOP TIME BEING SAME AS START TIME)
	- Flash the GREEN LED, wait for BLUE B1 button press and release
	
2. RUN Mode
	- GREEN LED is ON
	- Potentiometer sets the RPM of the motor for any zone/inlet (if manual)
	- Bi-Directional UART required (for displaying info and obtaining it)
	- Parse wall clock times entered to determine order
	- Motor driven from PWM signal (RPM controlled by PWM pulse width)
		1. 50,000 gal, 25 feet per day
		2. 30,000 gal, 50 feet per day
		3. 14,000 gal, 60 feet per day
		INLET: 94000 gallon capacity, 40 feet (NEED TO AVOID OVERFILLING)
	- Water reservoir gets filled overnight, then divides it out during the day
	- Selection of zone connection done by Servo; LED will light up as colour
		1. RED: Zone 1
		2. GREEN: Zone 2
		3. BLUE: Zone 3
		INLET: PURPLE: Inlet (dont need servo for this)
	- Direction of water from pump is opposite of water from inlet
	- Need to calculate and print the following values (All on one line):
		1) Wall Clock Time
		2) Zone/Inlet
		3) Moter Speed %PWM
		4) Motor RPM (must be based on revolutions per real-time minute, NOT SCALED INTERVALS!)
		5) Water Reservoir Depth
	- Lines are printed every wall clock hour OR when a SPECIAL EVENT occurs
	- Water depth is printed on the timer board in percentage terms
	- When water level is higher in resevoir, distance measurement will be lower!
	- Water depth is deermined using the distance sensor
		a) SPECIAL EVENT: Water reservoir reaches ZERO depth (depth: 2cm to 100cm)
			- turn off motor
			- update terminal to indicate reservoir is empty
			- display RGB sequence
			- GREEN LED on board turned off
			- system stops and waits for reset
